# Overview
This is a toy project where I'm developing a compiler, a custom ISA, and an emulator to run it all. I hope to one day get this to a point where the emulator, running a simple operating system, can bootstrap its own compiler.

This project is currently very much in flux. I'm currently finishing up the basic feature set of the compiler, which is resulting in a lot of changes all over the place. Things should start to stabilize out in a bit once I have flow control, code generation, and register allocation more or less figured out.
